# CouchDB-React Boilerplate

## A single-page react app using a couchdb backend

This project can serve as a starting point for any kind of full-stack application. It uses the React.js framework, the Material-ui library, i18next for internationalization and has a fully functional user management using the CouchDB API.

Currently that's all there is to it. Feel free to check out the [demo page](https://gocedoko.github.io/couchdb-react-boilerplate/), create a user, edit your profile and upload a photo. 

The purpose of this project is to help you get started with a very clean and up-to-date setup. Very soon however, this project will receive some new features and become a complete social network framework, so stay tuned.
